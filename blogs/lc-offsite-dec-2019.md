## Overview
The offsite took place on Thursday, December 19th 2019 at the Living Sky Cafe on the 3rd Ave S.
We had four developers of the team, sales engineer Jared Eason, product manager Levi Johnson,
engineering manager Hemant Naidu, UX designers Cam Johnson and Brendan Swalm for almost the entire time of the day.
We also invited guests from other divisions to join us. Special thanks go to Ed O'Keefe, Nolan Cline, Sarah Shell,
Chiara Traversa, and Brayden Fehr for their external perspectives.
We've made available the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rA8XXQsur9CP0pRIyyVudcRAeVJIcheSFOXiAtG-DAI/edit)
and [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194ooCx13y4LL-bi_6yXcnw-oZ11NWrwBLiQqj5_Y3GU/edit#heading=h.52rkah2hanpn)
for anyone who is interested in the details.

## Ice-breaker
To kick off the day, Corey planned a fun game for everyone and the game was to guess who wrote what.
Briefly, this game asked each participant to answer the questions in their assigned cards and then add
their own names along with a different one from one of the other attendants. For instance, Nathan was asked who
would he invite to host a late night show; Nathan answered Conan O'Brien (yeah you can't deny Conan's self-deprecation comedy
can you?); Nathan wrote down his name behind Levi who Nathan thought would give the same answer; then people were asked
who wrote down the answer from the two candidates; i.e., Nathan or Levi; sadly people chose Levi over Nathan lol.
It was a great 15-minute game that brought everyone closer.

## Company 3-year strategy and goals and Marketplace divisional goals
For this section, Levi did a quick recap of the company's 3-year strategies and goals, by highlighting what we wanted to accomplish
separately by the end of each year. Among the various goals, the one that specifically focuses on the Marketplace division
was to build Marketplace infrastructure to support new categories. To measure the success of these goals, Ed added
Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and North Star Metric. Two strategic pillars were laid out after: capture GMV and
allow SMBs to purchase direct from Cloud Brokers via our platform.
To capture GMV we would want to monetize transactions for quarterly revenue and profit.
To allow SMBs to purchase direct from Cloud Brokers via our platform we would want to do easy integration for independent software vendors (ISV).
The ISV integration was actually what the Lucky Charms team were going to do for 2020. Upon this offsite, Levi listed out four global brands that
the team would be integrating in 2020 and they are Google Cloud (Google version of the Amazon Web Service), FreshBooks (an accounting solution),
Symantec (cybersecurity software and services), and Deputy (a scheduling software & time clock app). For Q1, the team
would target FreshBooks integration first.
(Phew~, I hope what I've written so far for this section makes sense...if not or you wanna find more details,
